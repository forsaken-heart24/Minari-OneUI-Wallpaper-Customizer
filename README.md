for the wallpaper(s) and it's informations.

❣ i hope it would be an useful tool for you, thank me later if it is!

# Pre-requisites:
- Install openjdk or any java toolchain
- Borrow brain from a nerd if you don't know what are you doing:

# How to use this?

## Clone this repo if you still haven't done yet:
```
git clone https://github.com/forsaken-heart24/Minari-OneUI-Wallpaper-Customizer
```

## Execute the script:
- You need to switch to the cloned dir and you have to give executable permissions to minari.sh
- And after doing that you have to execute minari.sh in your local machine.

# I'm confused, what should i do?
## Just execute the script and follow the on-screen instructions, you'll get an idea by that.
